                    <p class="human-focused-description">Instead of focusing solely on your dog, we focus on you as well – the owner.
After all, you are the one who will be living with your dog day in and day out. Our training methods are designed to help you better understand your dog so that you can more effectively engage with them.
Dogs communicate primarily through body language. When you give verbal commands to your dog, they may not register it, and it isn't always because they intentionally want to go against you.
So rather than trying to pin your dog's failure to listen on one issue, start working with your dog from the ground up, trying everything you can until the command sticks. Remember to be an effective leader; give consistent commands with body language cues, and make sure that your dog understands what you are asking it to do before assuming that your dog simply doesn't want to listen to you.</p>
